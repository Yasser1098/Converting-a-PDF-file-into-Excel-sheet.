# Converting-a-PDF-file-into-Excel-sheet.
A freelance job that i was asked to do for a client and i have done it using pandas

# what is the job about?

I have done this job for a client as he asked me to convert a pdf file which i included in the files into an excel sheet that is similar to the excel file (Attach B)

# The process of conversion?
At first i had a pdf file that contains number of records that are not in a table form and required to transformed into an excel sheet so i tried to convert all these records into a pandas dataframe then i started spliting and manipulating this dataframe to get the desired format.
